		<h1>This is a webpage!</h1>
		<p>This is a simple webpage made by Ben Retzler as a way to test out various little parts of html.css while in a web dev class</p>
		<h2>About This Page</h2>
		<p>The goal of this page is to just make fun things and hopefully learn about how HTML works along the way so I can actually do something with it.</p>
		<h3>As for the rest of this page...</h3>	
		<p>I might add more things later, but as of right now this will be mostly empty as I have no idea what I want to have on this site and likely it will stay like that for a while as I try and make various things nad stuff</p>
